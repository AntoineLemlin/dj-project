# DJ Angerone's website

![logo](img/logo.png) 


## This project was realized by:
* Antoine Lemlin: https://github.com/AntoineLemlin
* Ludovic Vostès: https://github.com/ludovostes
* Eva Mélinand: https://github.com/Evamel


## When? Why this project?
In July 2021, DJ Angerone, who is a famous DJ, contacted us because he needs a website.
Over the last years, he released new album and became more and more famous. But he realized that he didn't reach people online.
He needed something to show his work to the online world.
He already saw a designer so we had to code the site respecting the designer's mock-up.


## What?
The aim is to inform people about new releases and incoming events.
You can find:
* Presentation of DJ Angerone
* Pictures
* Incoming events (*date and location*)
* New releases

In the future, you'll also find a ticket shop.

## Code
The site is responsive on the tablets portrait design and on mobiles.
We used HTML, CSS and some JavaScript to create it.
